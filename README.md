# -PriorityQueue-CLASS
The collection pq is a priority queue, so its elements are removed according to their priorities. The
element type for this queue is String, which has its own natural ordering: alphabetical order. So regardless of the order in which they are inserted, they are removed in alphabetical order
If the element type has no natural ordering, then PriorityQueue instances will apply the
compareTo() method to determine priorities among the elements.
